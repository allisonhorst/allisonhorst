Hi there! I teach environmental data science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. My teaching goal is to empower our graduate students with applied data science skills to responsibly work with and investigate questions using environmental data. I am also an artist with a background in *plein air* landscape oil painting - though more recently, I've been building up a library of open artwork for data science and statistics education.

### What am I up to? 

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently developing curriculum for our new [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) degree program at UCSB! 

- üå± One of my recent projects is the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R package, which I developed with Drs. [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (RStudio) and [Kristen B. Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) (University of Alaska Fairbanks). The package provides a dataset, `penguins` with structural size measurements for three penguin species recorded by Dr. Gorman and colleagues at the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research site, Antarctica. The `penguins` data is a near drop-in replacement for Anderson's `iris` dataset.

- üíª I'm also working with [Dr. Julien Brun](https://brunj7.github.io/about) to create a more expansive and versatile R data package containing sampler datasets from each of the 28 [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/) sites, for use in environmental data science and statistics courses. 

### Experience

- 2020 - present: Assistant Teaching Professor (UC Santa Barbara)
- 2013 - 2020: Lecturer (UC Santa Barbara)

### Education

- PhD (2012): Toxicity and interactions of engineering nanoparticles with environmental bacteria (UCSB)
- MS (2007): Mechanical Engineering (UCSB)
- BS (2005): Chemical Engineering (UCSB)

Hi there! I teach environmental data science at UC Santa Barbara. My teaching goal is to empower our students with applied data science skills to responsibly work with and investigate questions using environmental data. I am also an artist with a background in *plein air* landscape oil painting - though more recently, I've been building up a library of open artwork for data science and statistics education. I love creating open educational resources, developing & leading courses and workshop, and engaging with communities to support learners and users of data science tools. 

### What am I up to? 

- 🔭 I’m currently developing curriculum for the new [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) degree program at UCSB! Feel free to check out my very Under Construction new courses: 
    -  [EDS 212 - Essential Math for Environmental Data Science](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_212_essential-math/)
    -  [EDS 221 - Scientific Programming Essentials](https://allisonhorst.github.io/EDS_221_programming-essentials/)

- 🌱 One of my recent projects is the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R package, which I developed with Drs. [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (Voltron Data) and [Kristen B. Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) (University of Alaska Fairbanks). The package provides a dataset, `penguins` with structural size measurements for three penguin species recorded by Dr. Gorman and colleagues at the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research site, Antarctica. The `penguins` data is a near drop-in replacement for Anderson's `iris` dataset.
    
- 💻 I'm also working with [Dr. Julien Brun](https://brunj7.github.io/about) to create a more expansive and versatile R data package [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/), which contains sampler datasets from each of the 28 [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/) sites, for use in environmental data science and statistics courses. 

### Experience

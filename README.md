Hi there! I'm a Data Scientist Advocate at [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), working to support and learn from data scientists who want to explore, analyze, and visualize data together. I am also an artist with a background in *plein air* landscape oil painting - though more recently, I've been building up a library of open artwork for data science and statistics education. I love creating open educational content and resources, developing & leading data science courses and workshop, and engaging with communities to support learners and users of data science tools. 

### What am I up to? 

- üî≠ I recently played a leadership role in implementing the new [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) degree program at UCSB! 

- üå± One of my recent projects was the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R package, which I developed with Drs. [Alison Presmanes Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/) (Voltron Data) and [Kristen B. Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) (University of Alaska Fairbanks). The package provides a dataset, `penguins` with structural size measurements for three penguin species recorded by Dr. Gorman and colleagues at the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research site, Antarctica. The `penguins` data is a near drop-in replacement for Anderson's `iris` dataset, and has been adopted in data science tools, languages and platforms around the world.
    
- üíª With [Dr. Julien Brun](https://brunj7.github.io/about) I created a more expansive and versatile R data package [lterdatasampler](https://lter.github.io/lterdatasampler/), which contains sampler datasets from each of the 28 [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/) sites, for use in environmental data science and statistics courses.
